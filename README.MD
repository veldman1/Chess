## Features

- **Model-View-Controller** design for clear separation of game logic, UI and control.
- **Human and Bot players**: simply drop in new Bot implementations.
- **Configurable game clock** and move timers.
- **Save & Load** game logs in PGN, export current position as FEN.
- **JUnit test suite** covering core rules, move legality, check/checkmate, en-passant, and more.

## Extensibility & Overhauls

- **Swappable Bots**: drop your own `Player` implementation under `botIntelligence/`.  
- **Modular GUI**: view and controller components communicate via minimal interfacesâ€”feel free to replace Swing with JavaFX or web front-end.  
- **Robust logging**: PGN/FEN support remains irrespective of underlying rule changes.
